<br>
A Chemist by training, I completed my Ph.D in Chemistry, at University of Durham, back in 2009. I took a few years to figure out what I really wanted to do, looking for a role where science, tech, analysis, modelling, coding, problem solving, communication, and visualisation all intersected.

For the past decade and a half I've worked across academia, science and engineering in research and manufacturing companies and consultancies, assisting businesses ranging from 3-person outfits up to global mega-corps, always with a focus on the power of data; capturing, structuring, analysing, modeling, visualising - leveraging data and delivering insight for stakeholders.

Over the past 4-5 years I've transitioned to leadership, building a brilliant team of data engineers & scientists and software devs, who have worked on complex projects which have delivered high-value, needle-moving outputs, in line with strategic business goals.

This website is simply a blog and general repository for me to share my thoughts from the perspective of data professional. It will also act as a portfolio for code and analyses I thought would be interesting or useful to share.

_All opinions and thoughts are my own, drawn from my time in various business, and any code is mine to share._
