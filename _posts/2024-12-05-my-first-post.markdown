This is the intiation of a blog and website where I will share some outputs from 'data projects', muse on topics I face routinely at work as a DS and SWE manager, and generally act as a portfolio and repository for code, and record of my developments and achievements.

Any thoughts or code shared herein are my own, developed privately.

If you want to get in touch, please find my contact details (not yet sure where they are) and I'll aim to respond ASAP.
