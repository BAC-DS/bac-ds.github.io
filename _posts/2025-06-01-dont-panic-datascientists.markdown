Maybe you've read about the huge [tech layoffs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/tech-layoffs-2025-list/), or recently experienced the job market? Perhaps you've seen a few headlines or read some articles on LinkedIn, or your family have been asking you why you're needed now that everyone has ChatGPT...

It can sometimes feel like Data Science is dead - or at least dying.

## _So: What's going on?_


Time was, you could claim to be a Data Scientist if you were somebody who rattled around in a Jupyter notebook, did some üêºüêºüêº munging, spit out a few seaborn üìà or - whoop - a [Plotly Dashboard](), plugging away at a nice handful of csvs, gleaning insights that your stakeholders had never had before from their tired, dusty, flat data. A bit of causal inference via feature importance on a Random Forest classifier went a long way when some of the engineers' kids were born pre-decimalisation. Perhaps you're at a company where databases are witchcraft, and siloed Excel sheets are still the plat-du-jour. Some ETL, a quick sklearn pipeline to do some hyper-parameter tuning, whip up a truth table, and BAM: you've got the C-suite salivating...

Just better hope the excel sheets don't change too much for next month...

### FAANG have all the fun - at a cost!

But... and I say this with love ... a lot of this is just (admittedly quite advanced) data analysis. It isn't necessarily predictive, but rather it's descriptive - giving solid evidence for sometimes outside-the-box thinking, on historical events.

Yes, with some interpretation by a domain expert, it could allow for some predictions, however it is not the FAANG customer segmentation/predictor models which keep you hooked, scrolling or buying.

But __IT CAN'T BE__ - those companies live and breath data. Their systems are built to capture _more_ data. They are basically data companies! To be fair this is why they're ultimately the focus of our ire --- how much they know about us [link???] -- but it's also the reason that the machine learning engineers at these places get to deploy some seriously fun, powerful, value-adding models. A strong foundation of bountiful, good quality, data driven by an understanding that nailing collecting the right data will allow them to gain traction, build value, grow the user base... wash-rinse-repeat. The product is deployed to be interacted with and log all of that information; arguably the data IS the product -- it's just the user is not the customer.

## Most other companies: "Why can't we do that??"

Since 2010 I've worked in science or engineering companies and consultancies where I interfaced with dozens of client companies, ranging from SMEs to huge multinationals - the problem is systemic and ubiquitous.

Too many businesses have, for too long, considered data capture almost as an after-thought to their main aim, a nice to have, or a bonus - like you might collect random extra screws from IKEA furniture... "sure, it will be of value, but we'll sort it another day". I've seen data 'logged' for product control, manufacturing, or characterisation, in non-automated and non-scalable ways. Network drives full of csvs; groups reliant on sharepoint libraries of excel files; or teams which use their Teams' chats to dump data analysis outputs - even raw and aggregated files... They are barely digitialised in the proper sense, and hence these companies are poorly set up for out-of-the-box data science, the implementation of ML or AI.

The CXO have been getting wise to the issue for some time, and realise that ML/AI can be used to supercharge the business: to grow a user base, develop more accurate forecasts to optimise operations and inventory, adjust shift patterns, or even capitalise on the potential of GenAI and build internal chat-bots.

Some businesses are turning to vendors who offer off-the-shelf solutions to power their predictive analytics and AI strategies. Indeed for some industries (including the one I'm in) there are go-to software solutions which are now incorporating ML and AI in their latest versions, or bolt-on modules for more legacy systems. And more and more we see general platforms are offering 'AI-augmented' capabilities (I'm looking at you CoPilot!). 

Data scientists (or data-literate people) can play a huge role in helping businesses integrate and implement such systems, or as part of a wider data-democratisation piece.

However: data science, machine learning, AI - whether being developed from the ground-up internally, or using a purchased system - they are the cherry on the cake; by definition requiring a 'cake'. What is this cake?

__DATA. Consistent (ha), clean (lol), neat (loller), reliable (ok stop), live (FFS), high resolution data, logged automatically, into a database, and ready to access__

### So... we need some data scientists!?

Well - yes and no. I feel like data scientist could/has become an umbrella phrase for all of the nuanced roles which reside within the sphere of 'data analytics and predictive analytics', sometimes even encompassing data engineer. A general data strategy is required (which I will address in a future post), and it would be wise, in development of that, to have some key data personnel involved:

</figure>

I like data and building visualisations to tell a story (... obviously), so these radar plots above are my attempt to differentiate the skillsets that the various roles within a data team may possess and specialise in (the list is not exhaustive). You may or may not agree with this breakdown - it's anecdotal and based on my experience - but hopefully it makes the point of the core competencies required for the various roles. It also shows the huge degree of overlap between the roles. 

What it doesn't really allude to though is that, at different stages of a business, you need to lean heavily into those skills by differing amounts. A well established business which has 50 years of ledgers and 100 TB of files on hard drives containing all of their customer data, manufacturing records, IP ... They're going to need a Head of Data (or Digitalisation?) and likely a couple or even small team of data engineers to begin sorting out the infrastructure. A tech start-up formed 10 years ago is probably already on the cloud, and is 99% database driven: Data Scientist/ML Eng head-count green light!

## Why The Fall From Grace

I feel like the hype around Data Science some years back has been driven by the worrying misconception that most businesses collect data how Google or Amazon might, using best practises; normalised database tables following the Kimble model, APIs to interact with various data-logging systems, well documented code and database schema. Hahahaha...

[gif of laughing homer here]

Let's review the situation to understand, and try and apply some context:

- Data science relies on a strong data infrastructure and data-centric culture; this takes time to get right, and requires budget, resource, and CXO buy-in (or even CXO-led!)
- The corporate fables of a DS team deploying some sexy value-adding models that turn a company's fortune around over-night are rare, and very much the exception
 
On top of all of this, the softer, tertiary factors to consider include:

- Salary demands are bit nuts (thanks FAANG -- [$450k at Netflix?!](https://mikkeldengsoe.substack.com/p/data-salaries-2022?s=w#footnote-1))
- COVID hit us all like a brickwall...
	- which has been conflated by the move to remote work...
		- against which there is now a significant backlash
- There are some awful wars going on, a tanking economy and significant geopolitical instability; companies are risk averse and trimming headcount as a result
- The deployment of various GenAI platforms is rapidly improving everyone's capability to write code and understand their data better...
- **_so.... Data Scientists can be seen as a luxury

## What should you do about this?

The job market waxes and wanes - that's the nature of life. But be prepared for what the market needs by:
- keeping up-to-date with relevant skills (GenAI isn't going anywhere),
- building a project portfolio is great (if you can walk someone through some examples) and, crucially: 
- __assume you won't be handed a clean dataset - or maybe even data at all!__ The thousands of data science/ML/AI/next-big-thing degrees and courses need to stop cutting to the chase, and _focus on the basics_.

### Data Engineering

Sometimes your data won't be collected in a database; learn how to resolve this - look into best practises around data engineering, and become proficient with the basics of:
- ETL including by scripting & scraping
- data models including the star schema
- SQL!! __NON NEGOTIABLE__
- Basics of linux CLI commands
- Git (because accidents happen)

On prem or on-cloud - knowing the basics of these skills will get you a long way.

### Communication is KEY

I would say being able to communicate well is one of those really under-rated skills (generally!). Just think back to your teachers - you'll remember the good ones. 

To listen and to explain well is almost an art, and it's a key capability to demonstrate in any interview - certainly for technical topics, which data science absolutely qualifies as. 

- How confident and comfortable are you at discussing your own experience, or explaining project you've delivered and _really_ enjoyed? 

If you're faltering on such familiar ground (nerves, of course, can be understood), then that is something to work on.

Taking it further, when dealing with developing a project,  stakeholders won't always understand the intricacies of what they're asking of you; be it a model, or dashboard, or some analysis. It's your job to help guide that conversation, which can sometimes mean posing quite challenging questions.

On the other hand, some stakeholders will want to know how the data collection/pipeline needed to be improved to help with expectations next time. They may want to understand:

- the weightings of a certain model 
- how you tuned some parameters and what this means
- how a dashboard or even some model interface can be modified for additional functionality...

so get used to explaining the output and technical details in a way a non-coder can understand. It is, after all, their baby too!


# Final Thoughts

Data Science, or rather the role of the data scientist, is evolving. Expect it to continue to do so.

It was long overdue a correction, or reality check - a much-needed __refinement__ of a nascent field, bloated and under enormous pressure to deliver on huge and unfair expectations (thanks again FAANG!). 

It could not be expected to deliver the promised gains for the huge swathe of businesses that aren't fully digitalised.

However! To the people who have invested their time and money in their passion for data, who have developed their skills to understand statistics & coding, modelling, plotting, dashboards... there is PLENTY still to do, opportunities abound, and I don't see that going away any time soon. 

Pivot your pitch; you're a problem solver who knows advanced coding and statistics. That's a heady combination. As a data scientist, you're working across a stack of skills and capabilities. If you can own and enable each part, or at least more parts, of the __data --> insight__ pipeline and process, and understand the broader context of the puzzle you're trying to solve, you're of _incredible_ value. 

## __Accept the situation and adapt! And of course: Never üëè stop üëè developing üëè yourself.__
