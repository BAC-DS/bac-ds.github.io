I want to talk about Data Governance. It's a hot topic given the proliferation of data, genAI, regulation... and the inherent difficulties of that going un-managed for too long, BUT it is a crucial part of any business' data strategy. Indeed it underpins it.

I work in the Semicon industry, so thought I'd start with a quick *fab*le (hehe) 
to introduce-by-example the importance of data governance, before a subsequent post or posts, outlining the key tenets of data governance, and strategy for implementing.

### 🏭 **Company A: Silicore Ltd**

At first, Silicore was a scrappy start-up fab. Everything lived in Excel on someone’s laptop, labelled helpfully as:

> `FINAL_v6.1b_REAL_THIS_TIME_USE_THIS_ONE.xlsx`

Possibly some records were on a database, but the schema was on a post-it note on someone's monitor, and everyone had read/write access.

Well anyway, things were going great! Until..:

- Somebody asked where the customer delivery data was, and there were 4 different answers... and none of them agreed

- Three teams built “On-Time Delivery” dashboards, all quoting different metrics

- One KPI actually _improved_ after the engineer who created it left?!

- The finance team stopped asking for data and made some 'educated' guesses

Soon, Silicore’s analytics team was 60% firefighting, 20% off with stress, and 20% updating their CVs. The CXO banned the phrase “single source of truth” after it triggered a minor revolt.

When auditors came, Silicore gave them a zip file called `raw_exports_backup.zip`.

The auditors laughed, then left.

### 🏢 **Company B: Fabtastic Semiconductors Ltd**

From the start, Fabtastic was run by people who loved their Excel spreadsheets 😧, but loved knowing where the data came from even more.

They set up a data catalog early on. They gave their data owners name badges. Actual name badges. They taught their analysts what “golden source” meant.

As Fabtastic scaled:

- Their yield values were reported consistently

- Their KPIs weren’t debated like Brexit

- Everyone, from the CXO to new hires, understood the dashboards and could trace a metric back to the machine, wafer, or operator that produced it

Yes of course, there were SOPs, documents and policies. Even a data steering group and a governance council.

It wasn’t exciting (well... maybe for some) but then neither was _not knowing why your OEE dropped 12% last week_.

When they went for ISO accreditation they were able to show the auditors lineage diagrams so beautiful there were actual high-fives around the table.

### The Moral of the Fab-le?

- Data governance is not like a report, a dashboard, or a model -- it's not a '**data product**'. 

- It is the behavioural framework and *policy* surrounding how data is captured, stored and used within a business, allowing for transparency around its genesis, lineage, relationships & integrity

It will absolutely evolve with regulation and as the company scales and adapts. Furthermore, it won't just happen and suddenly be *there* -- it requires a mindset shift, which needs buy-in and vocal support, from the CXO and all the way across to those at the coal face.

Certainly it won’t make your dashboards sexier - we all know that's what dark mode is for 😎
