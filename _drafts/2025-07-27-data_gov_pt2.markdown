In my [last post](https://bac-ds.github.io/blog/general/2025/07/26/data_gov_pt1.html) I gave a tongue-in-cheek story about two (VERY fictional!) semiconductor manufacturing companies, exhibiting very different approaches towards and appetites for data governance, culminating in, well.... quite different results when auditors came knocking.

Frankly, passing an audit is barely even a side-benefit (admittedly it might be the ROI your SLT/CXOs are interested in!) but the day-to-day wins of a well executed and maintained data infrastructure, with ownership, documentation, versioning, quality, visibility provide extensive value for pretty much every facet of the business.

### **Purpose of a Data Governance Strategy**

Basically, the whole point is to build a system, or set of policies/frameworks/tools/widgets/*insert your internal corporate vernacular here*, that ensures data across the organisation is

- accurate
- secure
- accessible 
- used responsibly

Let's do the age-old _'If this was solved tomorrow, what would it look like?'_ thing... so - read the below and see if it sounds like some sort of utopia because, and I don't say this lightly, getting DG right will make __everything__ easier - for example:

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; text-align: center; color: #666;">Time for a bit of a rethink, and some data governance</figcaption>
</figure>

- knowing what data exists and who to ask about it
- secure access to that data
- analysis of data
- having confidence in the data and derived metrics
- visibility and clarity around metrics and KPIs
- understanding the reporting of metrics and KPIs

Which will all enable:
- appropriate and a considered democratisation of data
- tracking, visibility and optimisation of utilisation and performance of equipment
- tracability, testing and monitoring of products or parts
- generation, visibility, and - __ultimately__ - control of costings
- ability to make decisions on hiring, production, alterations, optimisation of systems... based on data
- you can finally call yourself **data-driven**


But be aware - for any business, in any industry, at any scale, __data governance takes effort__. 
It's like exercise and staying healthy and in-shape -- it's a way of life. 
Data governance isn't a data product that some day will just 'exist'.

So let's take a look at the key pillars of DG, and start to understand what they mean, and how to implement.

### **Key Pillars of a Data Governance Strategy**

- **Data Ownership & Stewardship**
    
    - Assign clear roles and responsibilities.
        
    - Typical roles: _Data Owners_ (accountable), _Data Stewards_ (hands-on custodians), _Data Custodians_ (IT side).
        
    - Define who can make decisions about data changes or access.
        
- **Data Quality Management**
    
    - Define standards for what makes data “good” (e.g. accuracy, completeness, timeliness).
        
    - Include routines for profiling, validation, cleansing, and monitoring.
        
- **Metadata Management**
    
    - Create a data catalogue or business glossary.
        
    - Helps users understand the data (definitions, lineage, usage, owners).
        
- **Data Privacy & Security**
    
    - Ensure compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
        
    - Define rules for data classification, access control, encryption, and audit logging.
        
- **Data Lifecycle Management**
    
    - Plan for data from creation through to archival and deletion.
        
    - Include policies for retention, archival, and disposal.
        
- **Master & Reference Data Management**
    
    - Maintain consistent definitions for core entities (e.g. customers, products).
        
    - Avoid duplication and ambiguity.
        
- **Policy & Standards Framework**
    
    - Develop enterprise-wide policies (e.g. naming conventions, data retention).
        
    - Define escalation paths when data issues arise.
        
- **Data Governance Council or Committee**
    
    - A cross-functional team that oversees strategy, resolves disputes, and enforces compliance.
        
- **Tools & Technology**
    
    - Leverage platforms for:
        
        - Data cataloguing (e.g. Collibra, Alation)
            
        - Access governance (e.g. Azure Purview, Informatica)
            
        - Lineage and monitoring (e.g. dbt, Monte Carlo)
            
10. **Measurement & Continuous Improvement**
    
    - Define metrics (e.g. % of critical data sets with stewards assigned, quality scores).
        
    - Regularly review and refine the strategy.

At any business, in any industry, at any scale, data governance is an effort. It's like exercise and staying healthy and in-shape -- it's a way of life. Data governance isn't a data product that some day will just 'exist'.

But - and I don't say this lightly - getting this right, will make _everything_ easier - for example:
- knowing what data exists and who to ask about it
- secure access to said data
- analysis of data
- responsibility for and ownership of data and derived metrics
- visibility and clarity around metrics and KPIs
- understanding of reporting of metrics and KPIs
Which will all enable:
- appropriate and a considered democratisation of data
- tracking, visibility and optimisation of utilisation and performance of equipment
- tracability, testing and monitoring of products or parts
- generation, visibility, and - __ultimately__ - control of costings

You can not claim to be a data-driven business unless you are are smashing this.
