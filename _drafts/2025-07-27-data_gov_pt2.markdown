To ensure that data across the organisation is **accurate, secure, accessible, and used responsibly**, supporting both operational needs and strategic goals.


### **üèõÔ∏è Key Pillars of a Data Governance Strategy**

1. **Data Ownership & Stewardship**
    
    - Assign clear roles and responsibilities.
        
    - Typical roles: _Data Owners_ (accountable), _Data Stewards_ (hands-on custodians), _Data Custodians_ (IT side).
        
    - Define who can make decisions about data changes or access.
        
2. **Data Quality Management**
    
    - Define standards for what makes data ‚Äúgood‚Äù (e.g. accuracy, completeness, timeliness).
        
    - Include routines for profiling, validation, cleansing, and monitoring.
        
3. **Metadata Management**
    
    - Create a data catalogue or business glossary.
        
    - Helps users understand the data (definitions, lineage, usage, owners).
        
4. **Data Privacy & Security**
    
    - Ensure compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
        
    - Define rules for data classification, access control, encryption, and audit logging.
        
5. **Data Lifecycle Management**
    
    - Plan for data from creation through to archival and deletion.
        
    - Include policies for retention, archival, and disposal.
        
6. **Master & Reference Data Management**
    
    - Maintain consistent definitions for core entities (e.g. customers, products).
        
    - Avoid duplication and ambiguity.
        
7. **Policy & Standards Framework**
    
    - Develop enterprise-wide policies (e.g. naming conventions, data retention).
        
    - Define escalation paths when data issues arise.
        
8. **Data Governance Council or Committee**
    
    - A cross-functional team that oversees strategy, resolves disputes, and enforces compliance.
        
9. **Tools & Technology**
    
    - Leverage platforms for:
        
        - Data cataloguing (e.g. Collibra, Alation)
            
        - Access governance (e.g. Azure Purview, Informatica)
            
        - Lineage and monitoring (e.g. dbt, Monte Carlo)
            
10. **Measurement & Continuous Improvement**
    
    - Define metrics (e.g. % of critical data sets with stewards assigned, quality scores).
        
    - Regularly review and refine the strategy.

### **üß≠ How It‚Äôs Typically Delivered**

- **Phase 1: Discovery & Assessment**

    - Current state analysis, stakeholder interviews, maturity assessment.

- **Phase 2: Governance Framework Design**

    - Define policies, roles, processes, and tools.

- **Phase 3: Pilot Implementation**

    - Apply governance to a key data domain (e.g. patient data, financial data).

- **Phase 4: Organisation-Wide Rollout**

    - Expand to other domains, integrate with data platforms and pipelines.

- **Phase 5: Operationalisation & Monitoring**

    - Ongoing stewardship, reporting, issue resolution, and optimisation.
