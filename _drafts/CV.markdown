## Experience

# Pragmatic Semiconductor

__Senior Manager - Data Science and Software Engineering; "Head of Manufacturing Intelligence"__

__Feb '22 - Present__

- Expanded headcount with a strong focus on diversity, building a multifunctional team (DBA-DE/DA/DS-MLEng), integrated across the UK and Europe 
  - Implemented DevOps and MLOps practices to streamline development and optimize machine learning operations
- Drove a strategic overhaul of key production department’s technical data logging and automated analysis capability
  - Including the implementation of bespoke ML approach to signal analysis, removing reliance on out-dated KPIs
  - Developed and directed a project utilizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoders to classify wafer maps based on yield signatures
  - ML approach improved accuracy in detecting patterns and anomalies, driving faster root cause analysis and enabling more efficient process optimization
- Spearheaded some low level marketing analytics (customer segmentation via RFM and KMeans and churn analysis) provided for exploratory understanding of CRM/ERP and social platforms’ interactions 
- Lead on pilot project scoping & developing RAG interface based domain-specific LLM 
- Deployed an internal API underpinning a self-service data portal
- Overhauled C-Suite-facing reporting, implementing dashboards, enabling improved visibility of KPIs, affording users’ drill-down capability
- Drove company-wide adoption of Tableau for BI/reporting
- Supported and guided compliance team for successful ISO 27K accreditation

__Data Scientist/Senior Data Scientist – Operations__

__Jul ‘18 – Jan ‘22__

- Technical leadership of data analytics on various task forces
  - Covering R&D, process development engineering projects
  - Winner of ‘Above & Beyond’ internal award for contribution to key business objective 
- Various analytical, statistical and ML techniques used to help understand complex interactions of a ~100 step high-tech manufacturing process with complex test outputs and improve process development cycles
- Excellent knowledge of key tecniques for EDA, feature engineering/selection, dimensionality reduction, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning
-- Performed tool performance monitoring and analysis to enable improved scheduling of maintenance events i.e. predictive maintenance (time series analysis using ARIMA/association rule)
-- Ensemble models (especially Random Forest) used to allow causal inference on sources of process issues - directly contributed to > 40% yield improvement over 1 month
-- Supporting engineers through statistical analysis to prove/disprove hypotheses, including use of A/B hypothesis testing
• Devised and developed Python code base and built and documented the in-house module for accessing all internal operations data across multiple data sources 
• Deployed Tableau as go-to BI/reporting tool across OPS and R&D platforms, and power user for dashboard development support/guidance
