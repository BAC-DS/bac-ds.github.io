### **1. Accept the Chaos (🫣)**

**Why:** You can’t fix what you don’t acknowledge.

Ask:

- What data assets do we have?

- Who is using them (or duplicating them)?

- What are our current data horror stories?


📌 _Tip:_ Collect internal "data horror anecdotes" it builds urgency without boring anyone with compliance slides.

---

### **2. Set the Intention (🧭)**

**Why:** Without a shared goal, governance feels like bureaucracy.

Ask:

- What do we want data governance to _enable_ — faster insights, fewer errors, better compliance?

- Who’s frustrated by unclear data today?


📌 _Tip:_ Frame governance as a **scaling enabler**, not a constraint. “This isn’t to slow you down — it’s to stop us re-solving the same problems weekly.”

---

### **3. Start Small, Start Smart (🎯)**

**Why:** Boil one kettle, not the ocean.

Start with:

- One domain (e.g. customer orders, yield tracking, finance KPIs)

- One dashboard, one warehouse, one dataset — **document it properly**

- Assign a data owner + steward (they can wear capes if it helps)


📌 _Tip:_ Show visible value quickly: clarity, speed, fewer meetings.

---

### **4. Make Metadata Discoverable (🔍)**

**Why:** If you can’t find your data, you’re not using your data.

Do:

- Adopt a catalog (start with open-source if needed — DataHub, OpenMetadata)

- Populate it with schema, glossary, and data owners

- Tag critical assets as “trusted”, “golden”, or “avoid at all costs”

📌 _Tip:_ Create a "Wall of Mystery Datasets" and reward anyone who documents one properly.

---

### **5. Embed Ownership (👑)**

**Why:** Without ownership, everyone’s a tourist.

Do:

- Assign **data owners** (accountable) and **data stewards** (responsible)

- Add them to catalog entries, reports, dashboards

- Make sure they know: _if no one owns it, no one trusts it_


📌 _Tip:_ Start by asking “who gets angry when this data is wrong?” — that’s your likely owner.

---

### **6. Build in Public (🛠️ + 📢)**

**Why:** Quiet governance is forgotten governance.

Do:

- Share lineage diagrams, metrics definitions, and glossary terms in team chats

- Invite feedback. Praise good documentation.

- Make your catalog linkable in dashboards, wiki pages, codebases


📌 _Tip:_ Use Teams/Slack to start a #data-clarity or #catalog-sightings channel. Reward “good governance sightings” like they’re rare birds.

---

### **7. Keep It Living (🧼)**

**Why:** Metadata ages like milk, not wine.

Do:

- Quarterly metadata review parties (yes, with snacks)

- Track metrics like % of certified datasets, # of searches in your catalog, # of documentation updates

- Decommission old assets ruthlessly — no one wants a haunted table

📌 _Tip:_ Appoint a Chief Data Exorcist to “cleanse” unused, outdated, or cursed datasets.
