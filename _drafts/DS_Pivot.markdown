You'll have grasped sentiment, or experienced the job market, or read the post on Medium/LinkedIn/elsewhere: __Data Science is dead__

_Spoiler:_ __Nope!__, just some course-correcting, role-clarification, and much needed expectation management up and down the value chain.

### Intro

Time was, you could claim to be a Data Scientist if you were somebody who rattled around in a Jupyter notebook, did some pandas munging, spit out a few seaborn plots or - whoop - a Plotly Dashboard, plugging away at a beautifully clean (ü§™) dataset, gleaming insights that the engineers/scientists/business devs/"stakeholders" had never had before from their own, rusty, data. A bit of causal inference via a Random Forest classifier went a long way when some of the engineers' kids were born pre-decimalisation. Perhaps you're at a company where databases are witchcraft, and siloed Excel sheets are still the plat-du-jour. Some ETL, a quick sklearn pipeline to do some hyper-parameter tuning, whip up a truth table, and BAM: you've got the C-suite salivating. Just better hope the excel sheets don't change too much for next month...

### FAANG have all the fun

But... and I say this with love ... a lot of this is just 'fancy' data analysis. It isn't necessarily predictive, but rather it's descriptive - giving solid evidence for sometimes outside-the-box thinking, on historical events. 
Yes, with some interpretation by a domain expert, it could allow for some predictions, however it is not the FAANG customer segmentation/predictor models which keep you hooked, scrolling or buying. But __IT CAN'T BE__ - those companies live and breath data. Their systems are built around the concept of capturing more data. To be fair this is why they're ultimately the focus of our ire --- how much they know about us [link???] -- but it's also the reason that the machine learning engineers at these places get to deploy some seriously fun, powerful, value-adding models. A strong foundation of bountiful, good quality, data driven by an understanding that nailing collecting the right data will allow them to gain traction, build value, grow the user base... wash-rinse-repeat. The product is deployed to be interacted with and log all of that information; arguably the data IS the product -- it's just the user is not the customer.

### Why can't we do that??

Historically, businesses have captured data almost as an after-thought, like you might collect random extra screws from IKEA furniture - sure it will be of value, but for worrying about another day. So data is often logged for product control, manufacturing, or characterisation, in non-automated, non-scalable ways. Network drives full of csvs; groups reliant on sharepoint libraries of excel files; or teams which use Teams chats to dump data analysis outputs - even raw and aggregated files... Hence they are poorly set up for out-of-the-box data science, the implementation of ML or AI. 

I've worked in high tech manufacturing, science & engineering companies and consultancies where I interfaced with dozens of client companies, ranging from SMEs to huge multinationals - the problem is systemic and ubiquitous. 

CEOs, CTOs and COOs have been getting wise to the issue for some time, however, seeing the news about the use of ML and AI to improve their performance: to grow a user base, develop more accurate forecasts to reduce stock, optimise hiring...  and... yeah, well, hence the boom in data science. Hence the 'gold rush'. Hence the 'sexist job'. Hence the salaries. However: data science, machine learning, AI... they all need (at least) one key element. 

__Data! Consistent (ha), clean (lol), neat (loller), reliable (ok stop), live (FFS), high resolution data, logged automatically, into a database__

### So we need some data scientists!?

Well - Yes and No. You need data 'specialists'.

Data Scientist
- Analysts
- Engineers
- Statistician
- ML

A data scientist, wide eyed and bushy tailed straight out of their MSc in Data Science from <PRETTY MUCH EVERY UNIVERSITY> will know exactly how to import some nice data, impute medians, run a t-test and give a p-value, build an ML pipeline, run a classifier, interpret those precision and accuracy numbers, maybe give you feature importances...

But the nice data may not exist.

So - can this freshly minted data scientist look at the disparate .xlsx/.json/txt/.log/ .pdat/.gis/.tech/.other files, and build a parser? Can they set up crontab so this happens without fail, all the time, over night, so data is fresh for the pipeline? Can they build a database, and develop a data model using the star schema?

Maybe? But probably not. And to be completely clear here:  __ they shouldn't have to! __ 

but recognising the potential of what they _could_ do, if only they used centralised databases, or captured information in a more automated or consistent manner, or asked different questions of their customers... The large software system vendors are certainly trying to grab their slice of the headache by offering different solutions... but data-scientists or data-minded people - who know whatunderstand the value of all this data requirement of data in ultimately delivering value from the data, are in significant demand

But in just understanding this, and accepting it, you can quickly pivot to developing yourself, recognising what kinds of skills are in demand, and get stuck in.
