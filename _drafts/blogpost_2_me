## Maximising the Efficacy of Your Data Team

I've asked these questions and seen them asked on Reddit numerous times.

At networking events, or when I've worked with contacts across dozens of companies, I've probed a bit and dug around to try to understand how it's handled there.

Moreover, I'm centrally involved in navigating this within my current company, as we grow and expand and the company and its data requirements evolve.

__What roles are in your data team?__
__What is the optimal structure of your data team?__
__Where do your data/data science team(s) sit within your company?__

We live in a time when using data to drive decision-making is critical, and not maximising its impact is basically leaving money on the table. As such, how you structure and position your data capability can make a significant difference!

Over the next couple of posts I'll outline what I've learned from reading around and talking with connections; but - as you will probably already know - there is no single answer that will definitively work. Multiple factors come into play, from type of business, stage of business growth, size of business, and maybe a couple more.

I share my thoughts below.

# What roles make up the data team?

This is tied really to a more core question (oops) --  what does a data team do?

The number of potential answers here scales with

$\sum business \times \left( CXO+SLT business \right) $

or rather: pretty much everyone is going to have an opinion; if they overlap, you're gold.

For me, primarily, a data team exists to structure, organise, manage and use the data collected by a company, to derive insights and provide value to the business.


Pt 1 -- include what's in a data team

Pt 2 -- structure 1

Pt 3 -- structure 2

Pt 4 -- hybrids

# The Matrix Model

Or the cross functional, or 'horizontally aligned', model.

In this approach, data professionals (engs, analysts, scientists) are embedded across the different departments. In some business this will be how the PMO or HR functions are distributed - where you have a dedicated OPS HR team, or specific 'Product' PMO group. The data team similarly don't report in to a single business line, but instead supports multiple teams in parallel.

**Diagram 1: Matrix Model**


**#Wins**

- Close proximity to business units allows data scientists to understand domain-specific challenges.

- Analysts are constantly working on relevant, real-world business problems.

- Iteration cycles are shorter thanks to closer collaboration with stakeholders.

**#Fails**

- Without strong leadership from a central data function, standards and tooling can diverge.

- Data professionals can be pulled in too many directions without clear prioritisation.

- With potential dual reporting lines (e.g., to both a functional head and a business lead) mentorship and progression may suffer.

### 2. The Standalone (Centralised) Model

In a standalone model, the data team functions as an independent unit, often under IT, Strategy, or Technology. This team handles requests from various departments, prioritising work based on organisational goals.

**Diagram 2: Centralised Model**

```
                       +------------------------+
                       |   Central Data Team    |
                       | (Science, Eng., BI)    |
                       +------------------------+
                               /|\
                                |
        +----------------------+-------------------------+
        |                      |                         |
+---------------+    +----------------+       +-----------------+
|  Marketing    |    |   Operations   |       |   Product Team  |
+---------------+    +----------------+       +-----------------+
```

**Pros:**

- **Consistency:** Tools, standards, and models are centralised, enabling quality control.
    
- **Skill development:** Colocation allows for shared learning, mentoring, and a clear career path.
    
- **Strategic alignment:** Easier to align data initiatives with top-level organisational goals.
    

**Cons:**

- **Detachment from business:** Without regular interaction, data teams may miss important context.
    
- **Bottlenecks:** A central team can become overwhelmed with requests, leading to delays.
    
- **Reduced agility:** Lack of deep domain immersion can hinder responsiveness to fast-changing team needs.

### 3. Hybrid and Evolving Models

Some organisations opt for a hybrid structure, blending elements of both. For instance, a central data team might own core infrastructure, data governance, and ML platform development, while embedded analysts or scientists are assigned to business units for specific initiatives.

This hybrid model attempts to get the best of both worlds: strong governance from the centre, and tight alignment with business needs at the edge.

**Implementation Tips for a Hybrid Model:**

- **Clear roles:** Define what’s owned centrally vs. locally.
    
- **Regular syncs:** Cross-functional stand-ups or review boards help coordinate work and maintain standards.
    
- **Rotations:** Let data staff rotate between central and embedded roles to promote knowledge sharing.

### 4. Transitioning Between Models

Organisations often shift between models as they grow. Here’s how to approach a change:

#### Centralised → Matrix

- **Prepare for decentralisation:** Create toolkits, documentation, and governance standards.
    
- **Build trust:** Let embedded teams gradually take more ownership while checking in centrally.
    
- **Maintain oversight:** Keep a dotted-line relationship to ensure alignment.
    

#### Matrix → Centralised

- **Audit current state:** Identify inefficiencies, duplication, or gaps in quality.
    
- **Consolidate gradually:** Begin by centralising high-leverage functions like infrastructure and governance.
    
- **Promote the value:** Showcase how centralisation can enable more strategic initiatives.

### 5. Final Thoughts

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The "best" structure depends on your organisation’s size, maturity, leadership culture, and business model. A startup might benefit from embedded analysts sitting with product teams, while an enterprise might prioritise governance and scalability.

The key is clarity: clear goals, clear ownership, and clear communication. With those in place, your data function can thrive regardless of structure.

**Have you recently restructured your data team?** Share your insights in the comments – what worked, what didn’t, and what you’d do differently next time.







But immediately, I can argue this is a flawed question.

You can't have standalone data scientists any more -- 

Opt1
DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE IS KEY

Opt2
NUMBERS ARE NUMBERS - DATA IS DATA


Given that "data is the new oil" in terms of value derived, and building on my earlier post


There is no one size fits all - that is for sure.

Following things to consider

- type of company (tech, science, manufacturing, property, financial)
