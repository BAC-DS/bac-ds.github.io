What?

Yep.

What's this about?


## 🧑‍⚖️ **Data Owner**

**Accountable for the data.**

### Responsibilities:

- Decides **who can access** or change the data.
    
- Approves major changes to the structure or use of data.
    
- Ensures data aligns with **business goals**, compliance, and risk requirements.
    
- Typically a **senior stakeholder** (e.g. Head of Finance owns financial data; Head of Ops owns production data).
    

### Think of them as:

> “The landlord” — they don't do the gardening or maintenance, but they decide what happens to the property and who can rent it.

## 🧑‍🔧 **Data Steward**

**Responsible for the quality and integrity of the data.**

### Responsibilities:

- Maintains **accurate definitions**, formats, and rules.
    
- Documents the data (e.g. what it means, what values are allowed).
    
- Works with teams to **resolve data quality issues**.
    
- Acts as the **day-to-day guardian** of the dataset.
    
- Usually more hands-on — often a data analyst, business analyst, or subject matter expert.
    

### Think of them as:

> “The caretaker” — they make sure the place is clean, safe, labelled correctly, and running smoothly.
