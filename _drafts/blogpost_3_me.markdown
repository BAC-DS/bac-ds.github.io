# The Matrix Model

Or the cross functional, or 'horizontally aligned', model.

In this approach, data professionals (engs, analysts, scientists) are embedded across the different departments. In some business this will be how the PMO or HR functions are distributed - where you have a dedicated OPS HR team, or specific 'Product' PMO group. The data team similarly don't report in to a single business line, but instead supports multiple teams in parallel.

**Diagram 1: Matrix Model**


**#Wins**

- Close proximity to business units allows data scientists to understand domain-specific challenges.

- Analysts are constantly working on relevant, real-world business problems.

- Iteration cycles are shorter thanks to closer collaboration with stakeholders.

**#Fails**

- Without strong leadership from a central data function, standards and tooling can diverge.

- Data professionals can be pulled in too many directions without clear prioritisation.

- With potential dual reporting lines (e.g., to both a functional head and a business lead) mentorship and progression may suffer.

### 2. The Standalone (Centralised) Model

In a standalone model, the data team functions as an independent unit, often under IT, Strategy, or Technology. This team handles requests from various departments, prioritising work based on organisational goals.

**Diagram 2: Centralised Model**

```
                       +------------------------+
                       |   Central Data Team    |
                       | (Science, Eng., BI)    |
                       +------------------------+
                               /|\
                                |
        +----------------------+-------------------------+
        |                      |                         |
+---------------+    +----------------+       +-----------------+
|  Marketing    |    |   Operations   |       |   Product Team  |
+---------------+    +----------------+       +-----------------+
```

**Pros:**

- **Consistency:** Tools, standards, and models are centralised, enabling quality control.
    
- **Skill development:** Colocation allows for shared learning, mentoring, and a clear career path.
    
- **Strategic alignment:** Easier to align data initiatives with top-level organisational goals.
    

**Cons:**

- **Detachment from business:** Without regular interaction, data teams may miss important context.
    
- **Bottlenecks:** A central team can become overwhelmed with requests, leading to delays.
    
- **Reduced agility:** Lack of deep domain immersion can hinder responsiveness to fast-changing team needs.

### 3. Hybrid and Evolving Models

Some organisations opt for a hybrid structure, blending elements of both. For instance, a central data team might own core infrastructure, data governance, and ML platform development, while embedded analysts or scientists are assigned to business units for specific initiatives.

This hybrid model attempts to get the best of both worlds: strong governance from the centre, and tight alignment with business needs at the edge.

**Implementation Tips for a Hybrid Model:**

- **Clear roles:** Define what’s owned centrally vs. locally.
    
- **Regular syncs:** Cross-functional stand-ups or review boards help coordinate work and maintain standards.
    
- **Rotations:** Let data staff rotate between central and embedded roles to promote knowledge sharing.

### 4. Transitioning Between Models

Organisations often shift between models as they grow. Here’s how to approach a change:

#### Centralised → Matrix

- **Prepare for decentralisation:** Create toolkits, documentation, and governance standards.
    
- **Build trust:** Let embedded teams gradually take more ownership while checking in centrally.
    
- **Maintain oversight:** Keep a dotted-line relationship to ensure alignment.
    

#### Matrix → Centralised

- **Audit current state:** Identify inefficiencies, duplication, or gaps in quality.
    
- **Consolidate gradually:** Begin by centralising high-leverage functions like infrastructure and governance.
    
- **Promote the value:** Showcase how centralisation can enable more strategic initiatives.

### 5. Final Thoughts

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The "best" structure depends on your organisation’s size, maturity, leadership culture, and business model. A startup might benefit from embedded analysts sitting with product teams, while an enterprise might prioritise governance and scalability.

The key is clarity: clear goals, clear ownership, and clear communication. With those in place, your data function can thrive regardless of structure.

**Have you recently restructured your data team?** Share your insights in the comments – what worked, what didn’t, and what you’d do differently next time.







But immediately, I can argue this is a flawed question.

You can't have standalone data scientists any more -- 

Opt1
DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE IS KEY

Opt2
NUMBERS ARE NUMBERS - DATA IS DATA


Given that "data is the new oil" in terms of value derived, and building on my earlier post


There is no one size fits all - that is for sure.
