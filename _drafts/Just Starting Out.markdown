## 1. The Job Advert 


(Thanks ChatGPT)

>> "generate a short and generic job advert for a data scientist to join a company"

Which returns:

### Job Title: Data Scientist

__Location: [Insert Location] / Hybrid__    
__Company: [Company Name]__    
__Type: Full-Time__ 
__Pay: 0.6 X 'THE AVERAGE'.... ðŸ˜•

Weâ€™re looking for a curious and capable Data Scientist to join our growing team. Youâ€™ll work on meaningful problems, turning data into insights that drive smarter decisions across the business. From building predictive models to crafting intuitive dashboards, you'll help shape our data-driven future.

#### What youâ€™ll need:

- Strong skills in Python, SQL, and statistical analysis
- Experience with machine learning and data visualisation tools
- Ability to translate business questions into data problems
- A proactive mindset and collaborative spirit

#### Nice to have:

- Experience in [industry or domain, if relevant]
- Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Sure, add some bells and whistles, maybe some specifics about the types of ML they'll want you to be using, or maybe something even more generic (and scarier) about communicating to C-suite or VPs and non-specialist audiences... you get the pic
