I've asked these questions and seen them asked on Reddit numerous times.

At networking events, or when I've worked with contacts across dozens of companies, I've probed a bit and dug around to try to understand how it's handled there.

Moreover, I'm centrally involved in navigating this within my current company, as we grow and expand and the company and its data requirements evolve.

__What roles make up your data team?__
__What is the optimal structure of your data team?__
__Where do your data/data science team(s) sit within your company?__

We live in a time when using data to drive decision-making is critical, and not maximising its impact is basically leaving money on the table. As such, how you structure and position your data capability can make a significant difference!

Over the next couple of posts I'll outline what I've learned from reading around and talking with connections; but - as you will probably already know - there is no single answer that will definitively work. Multiple factors come into play, from type of business, stage of business growth, size of business, and maybe a couple more.

I share my thoughts below, by first addressing a core question ...

# What does a data team do?

The number of potential answers here scales approximately as:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>

$$ \text{N}_{ops} \propto \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Businesses}_i \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{CXOs}_i $$

Where:
- _Businesses_ is the number of distinct businesses, business units, departments, or initiatives.
- _CXOs_ is the number of people in leadership or SLT roles in each unit.
- And "N" is a chaotic, ever-growing scalar quantity.

#### In English? Pretty much everyone is going to have an opinion; if they overlap, you're gold üëç

For me, a data team exists to structure, organise, manage and use the data collected by a company, to derive insights, enable, and provide value to the business.

This helps us understand some key roles that could constitute a data team...

__Storing and structuring data__ requires some _data_ and _database engineers_; and managing, controlling & monitoring these systems could involve a dedicated _database administrator_.

__Capturing data__ will likely be done by software; either be off-the-shelf or perhaps something developed internally; a bespoke solution. This could be a simple script which parses automatically generated files, or a full blow web app which interfaces with other systems This would involve some capacity of _software developers_, but also _data engineers_.

__Enabling Access, including via Self-Service Analytics__ is more and more a key objective of the data team, allowing wider teams to interrogate and analyse the data in a safe and simple environment. This capability, developed by _data analysts_ and _data engineers_ working together perhaps with _business analysts_ unburdens the data team from the day-to-day, tactical requirements, allowing _data analysts_ and data scientists to focus on the strategic projects, with greater value-add.

__Building and deployment of Data Products__ such as forecasting models, classifier systems or recommendation engines, will be one of the more visibile and headline-making outputs of a well-established data team; primarily driven by _data scientists_ and _ML engineers_.

__Driving Insight and supporting decisions__



__Ensuring security, compliance, and strategic roadmapping__
